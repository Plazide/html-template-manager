# HTML Template Manager
This is a simple HTML template manager.

## How to use?
Right now there is no CLI implemented, so the best way to use this tool is to clone this repo and then run:
```
node index.js
```
This will assume that your template is places in a file called template.html located in ```./templates```, and your editable html files are places in ```./static```.
